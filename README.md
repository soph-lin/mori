## Getting Started

To set up the web app locally, follow this guide.

### Install pnpm package manager

`pnpm` is a package manager built on top of `npm` and is much faster than `npm`, being highly disk efficient and solving inherent issues in `npm`.

Install `pnpm` if you don't already have it:

```
npm install -g pnpm
```

**Optional: set up a shorter alias like pn instead**

For POSIX systems, add the following to your .bashrc, .zshrc, or config.fish:

`alias pn=pnpm`

For Powershell (Windows), go to a Powershell window with admin rights and run:

`notepad $profile.AllUsersAllHosts`

In the profile.ps1 file that opens, put:

`set-alias -name pn -value pnpm`

Now whenever you have to run a `pnpm` cmd, you can type in `pn` (or whatever alias you created) instead.
